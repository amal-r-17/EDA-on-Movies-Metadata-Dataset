# EDA-on-Movies-Metadata-Dataset

![movies](moviepics.jpg)

Here I have tried to do EDA on the movies metadata dataset.

The dataset had a lot of null values and I tried tackling that by removing those rows which has more than 5 null values.

Here, from the dataset I have extracted data like,
* Most popular movies
* Highest Grossing movies
* Popular Director 

and many more.
